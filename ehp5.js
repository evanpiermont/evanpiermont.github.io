    abs: `In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework to analyze an agent who misinterprets or misperceives the true decision problem she faces. Within this framework, we show that a wide range of behavior observed in experimental settings manifest as failures to perceive implications, in other words, to properly account for the logical relationships between various payoff relevant contingencies. We present behavioral characterizations corresponding to several benchmarks of logical sophistication and show how it is possible to identify which implications the agent fails to perceive. Thus, our framework delivers both a methodology for assessing an agent's level of contingent thinking and a strategy for identifying her beliefs in the absence full rationality.`,

    abs: `This paper examines how a decision maker might incentivize an expert to reveal novel aspects of the decision problem, expanding the set of contracts from which the decision maker can choose. The chosen contract will determine, along with the resolution of uncertainty, the payoffs to both players. I show that the set of achievable outcomes under any (incentive compatible) mechanism is characterized by a small and tractable class of iterated revelation mechanisms (IRMs). An IRM is a dynamic interaction wherein each round the expert chooses to reveal some novel contingencies and the decision maker proposes a contract that the expert can accept or reject; the IRM ends after rejection or when nothing novel is revealed. I then consider the set of robust IRMs -- those that maximize the worst case outcome across all types of expert -- and show these are characterized by a principle of myopic optimality: at each round, the decision maker maximizes his payoff as if the expert had nothing further to reveal. The set of robust IRMs also delineate the payoffs achievable by any efficient mechanism.` ,

    abs: `We consider an analyst whose goal is to identify a subject's utility function through revealed preference analysis. We argue the analyst's preference about which experiments to run should adhere to three normative principles: The first, Structural Invariance, requires that the value of a choice experiment only depends on what the experiment may potentially reveal. The second, Identification Separability, demands that the value of identification is independent of what would have been counterfactually identified had the subject had a different utility. Finally, Information Monotonicity asks that more informative experiments are preferred. We provide a representation theorem, showing that these three principles characterize Expected Identification Value maximization, a functional form that unifies several theories of experimental design. We also study several special cases and discuss potential applications.`,

In our main result, each alternative is identified with a subset of an (endogenously defined) state space, and two axioms characterize maximin decision making. This means: from the agent's preferences over alternatives, we derive a preference order on the endogenous state space, such that alternatives are ranked in terms of their worst outcomes.`,

    abs: `In dynamic settings each economic agent's choices can be revealing of her private information. This elicitation via the rationalization of observable behavior depends each agent's perception of which payoff-relevant contingencies other agents persistently deem as impossible. We formalize the potential heterogeneity of these perceptions as disagreements at higher-orders about the set of payoff states of a dynamic game. We find that apparently negligible disagreements greatly affect how agents interpret information and assess the optimality of subsequent behavior: When knowledge of the state space is only 'almost common', strategic uncertainty may be greater when choices are rationalized than when they are not--forward and backward induction predictions, respectively, and while backward induction predictions are robust to small disagreements about the state space, forward induction predictions are not. We also prove that forward induction predictions always admit unique selections a la Weinstein and Yildiz (2007) (also for spaces not satisfying richness) and backward induction predictions do not.`,

This paper axiomatizes the behavior of a DM who derives utility directly via consumption and also via the induced image. Because the image depends on what could have been chosen, the DM will display menu-dependent preferences. I consider two models: in the first, the modeler observes two stages of choice—over menus and then from the chosen menu; in the second, only the latter choices are observed. The two models share the same representation but uniqueness is obtained only in the first.`,

Following Pearl [2000], we represent causality using causal models (also called structural equations models), where the world is described by a collection of variables, related by equations. We show that if a preference relation over interventions satisfies certain axioms (related to standard axioms regarding counterfactuals), then we can define (i) a causal model, (ii) a probability capturing the decision-maker’s uncertainty regarding the external factors in the world and (iii) a utility on outcomes such that each intervention is associated with an expected utility and such that intervention A is preferred to B iff the expected utility of A is greater than that of B. In addition, we characterize when the causal model is unique. Thus, our results allow a modeler to test the hypothesis that a decision maker’s preferences are consistent with some causal model and to identify causal judgements from observed behavior.`,

Properties are unary predicates on objects; concepts are Boolean combinations of properties. An agent can then be partially aware of a concept if she is aware of the concept in the abstract without being aware of the properties that de- fine it. The logic also allows for quantification over objects and properties so that the agent can reason about her own un- awareness. We then apply the logic to contracts. Contracts are syntactic objects that dictate outcomes based on the truth of formulae. The set of feasible contracts is limited by the for- mulae the agents are aware of.

Beliefs, preferences over outcomes, and a degree of reference-dependence characterize the utility representation, and all are uniquely identified from behavior. Moreover, we establish a link between reference-dependence and attitudes towards uncertainty. In particular, we show within our framework, loss aversion and reference dependence are equivalent to max-min expected utility. Finally, we apply our model to sealed bid auctions where equilibrium bidding strategies are higher bids than risk-neutrality, and hence are more closely aligned with experimental findings.`,

The DM has a ranking over consumption alternatives that is informed by her epistemic state (i.e., what she knows and what she is aware of), which can serve as a foundation for well known models. The main result is a characterization, via observable choice, of introspective unawareness --a DM who is both unaware of some information and aware she is unaware. In static environments, or when the DM is blind to her own ignorance, the presence of unawareness does not produce any observable choice patterns. However, under dynamic introspective unawareness, the DM will be unwilling to commit to making future choices, even when given the  exibility to write a contingent plan that executes a choice conditional on the realization of uncertain events. This is a behavior that cannot be explained by uncertainty alone (i.e., without appealing to unawareness).`,

When the decision maker chooses what to consume, she also chooses the information structure to which she will be exposed. When she consumes outcomes, she learns her relative preference between them; after each consumption history, the decision maker's information structure is a refinement of the previous information structure. We provide the behavioral restrictions corresponding to an infinite horizon, recursive representation that exhibits such a learning process. Moreover, through the incorporation of dynamics we are able to identify the set of preferences the decision maker believes possible after each history of consumption.
